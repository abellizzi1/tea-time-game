## How To Play
- When loading the main menu, you can start game or exit. When starting the game, you will be loaded into scene 1.
- Kill the amount of goblins specified in the top right. WASD to move, R to reload, Mouse1 to shoot. The weapon will aim in the direction your mouse is pointing at.
- Enemies will randomly drop $150. This can be spent on power-ups in the shop later on. Run into them to pick them up.
- After killing enough goblins, you will be teleported to the next scene. We have 5 scenes, plus a shop and boss scene.
- After scenes 2 and 4, you will be loaded into the shop. You can purchase from 4 static upgrades and/or 2 randomly selected power-ups. There is a weapon rack with 3 randomly selected weapons that you can use to swap out your current weapon. The 3 randomly selected weapons will never include your currently equipped weapon. The door to exit is on the right - a prompt to exit will appear when you go to it.
- After killing the required amount of enemies in scenes 1, 3, 5, and the boss fight, an item will float down in the middle of the scene. After completing scene 5 the you will be teleported to the boss room, which includes a multi-stage boss fight. After defeating the boss you can choose to continue and restart at scene 1. All power-ups/money obtained will remain persistent.
- ESC for pause menu
